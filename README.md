# Challenge Goals
USERNAME ENUMERATION: The color GREEN has the vulnerability. It sets the string "Log in was unsuccessful" to bold if the username is found but password is incorrect (as tested with jmonroe99) but does not set to bold if the username is not found.

IDOR: The color RED has the vuknerability. It allows access to different details of different salespeople just by changing their IDs while other colors send you back to the same page that was previously loaded.
